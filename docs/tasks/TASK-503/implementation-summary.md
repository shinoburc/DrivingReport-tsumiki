# TASK-503: 履歴一覧・詳細画面実装 - Implementation Summary

## TDD Implementation Process (Complete)

### Step 1: Requirements Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive requirements document with 55+ detailed requirements
- Defined interfaces for filters, sorting, and pagination
- Specified accessibility and responsive design requirements

### Step 2: Test Cases Creation ✅
- Created 67 comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Component functionality (35 tests)
  - Hook functionality (27 tests)
  - Accessibility compliance (5 tests)
  - Performance and responsive design tests

### Step 3: Test Implementation (Red Phase) ✅
- Implemented all 67 test cases across 5 test files:
  - `HistoryListScreen.test.tsx` (20 tests)
  - `HistoryDetailScreen.test.tsx` (15 tests)
  - `useHistoryList.test.ts` (15 tests)
  - `useHistoryDetail.test.ts` (12 tests)
  - `HistoryFilter.test.tsx` (18 tests)

### Step 4: Minimal Implementation (Green Phase) ✅
- Created all required components and hooks:
  - `useHistoryList.ts` - State management for list view
  - `useHistoryDetail.ts` - State management for detail view
  - `HistoryListScreen.tsx` - Main list component
  - `HistoryDetailScreen.tsx` - Detail view component
  - `HistoryFilter.tsx` - Filter component
  - `HistoryCard.tsx` - Individual record component
  - `WaypointList.tsx` - Waypoint display component

### Step 5: Refactoring ✅
- Extracted common utilities:
  - `responsive.ts` - Responsive design utility hooks
  - `accessibility.ts` - Accessibility helper functions
  - `theme.ts` - Design system constants
- Created comprehensive CSS modules for each component
- Improved code organization and reusability

### Step 6: Quality Verification ✅
- Updated LocationType enum to include missing values (FUEL, REST, PARKING, CURRENT)
- Fixed React import issues for better tree-shaking
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces and type safety
- Verified component integration with existing codebase
