### Cache Strategy Implementation
- **App Shell Cache**: Cache First for HTML, CSS, JS, images
- **API Requests**: Network First with cache fallback for GET, queue for POST/PUT/DELETE
- **Runtime Cache**: Stale While Revalidate for optimal performance
- **Cache Versioning**: Automatic cleanup of old cache versions
- **Cache Limits**: Size monitoring and cleanup when approaching limits

### Background Sync Implementation
- **Queue Management**: IndexedDB-based operation queue with priority
- **Sync Triggers**: Connection recovery, periodic, user operation, app startup
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic merge for compatible changes, user choice for conflicts
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable max attempts
- **State Persistence**: Sync state saved across app restarts

### Security Implementation
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Service Worker only works on HTTPS or localhost
- **Content Validation**: Malicious content detection and blocking
- **Origin Restrictions**: Cross-origin request filtering
- **Data Encryption**: User data encrypted before caching
- **Privacy Controls**: Consent-based data collection and processing
